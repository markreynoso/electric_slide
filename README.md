## Overview
```electric_slide``` implements artificial intelligence and machine learning to efficiently solve the classic [sliding puzzle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle)

## Website
[Check it out](http://electric-slide.herokuapp.com)

## Getting Started
- Clone down the repository to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/markreynoso/electric_slide.git
```
- Once your download is complete, cd into the ```electric_slide``` repository:
```
$ cd electric_slide
```
- Create a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it:
```
electric_slide $ python3 -m venv ENV
electric_slide $ . ENV/bin/activate
```
- Install the project in editable mode along with its testing requirements, via pip:
```
(ENV) electric_slide $ pip install -e .[testing]
```
- Test your project, via pytest:
```
(ENV) electric_slide $ py.test
```
- Begin serving your application, via the ```pserve``` command:
```
(ENV) electric_slide $ pserve development.ini --reload
```
